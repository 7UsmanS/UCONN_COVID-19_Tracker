# UCONN_COVID-19_Tracker
UCONN Database for COVID-19 Positive Case Tracking


The objective of the project is to build a database that will reflect Fall 2020 UCONN students that have tested positive for COVID-19.  In addition to reflecting basic student information, the database will also include whether the student lives on campus (and if so, what residence hall they live in), course information by campus, what courses each student is registered for, whether the courses are remote or held in person, and if the student tested positive for COVID-19, as well as the date when the positive test occurred.  If a student tests positive for COVID the database can provide insight into what courses that student has attended in person and what residence hall they live within, along with other students that may have been exposed by attending the same class or living in the same residence hall.  Knowing who has potentially been exposed can enable UCONN to quickly define who may need to be tested for COVID and possibly quarantined in order to mitigate further spread.
